             <p><strong>Tribhuvanath Dasa :</strong>  Once Prabhupada was taking prasadam in his room. Yamuna had cooked for him, and Malati was running up and down with fresh puris. I heard her shuffling up and down the stairs, and I was fascinated, so I popped my head around the corner, and there was Malati saying, <i>"Prabhupada, how many puris can you eat?" </i>She had brought a lot of puris while Prabhupada was respecting prasadam. Prabhupada's eyes got big, and he said, <i><strong>"More than you can make," </strong></i>and laughed. He seemed ecstatic.</p>
