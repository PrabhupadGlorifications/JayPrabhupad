            <p>"I know that you poor girl have been frustrated by the so called society and you deeply needed the
                shelter of Krishna Consciousness. Krishna kindly sent you to me and I have tried to give you whatever I
                had in my possession. Please go on chanting Hare Krishna Hare Krishna as you are doing now and this very
                chanting will give you all peace and prosperity both in this life and the next. Never expect any good
                from the so called society, friendship and love. Only Krishna is the genuine friend of all living beings
                and it is He only who can give us all benediction. The more you advance in Krishna Consciousness
                chanting Hare Krishna Hare Krishna the more you become spiritually advanced and happy in all respects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The separation which you are feeling on account of my physical absence is good sign. The more you feel
                such separation the more you will be situated in Krishna Consciousness. Lord Caitanya felt this
                separation and His process of approaching Krishna is the feeling of separation."</p>
