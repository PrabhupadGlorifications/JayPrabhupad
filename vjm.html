             <p>He (Visnujana Maharaj) would simply not care. His fingers would bleed heavily, he simply did not seem to realise the pain. He would beat the Mrdanga for 18 hours-20 hours and the enthusiasm he carried just never seemed to fade even though everybody else would slow down after a few hours he in contrast got more enthusiastic with the increasing hours. Sometimes, down the lower left street, His blood decorated the streets dripping yet he kept on banging his Mrdanga! Later some of the devotees wrapped his hands up with a gauze & eventually we found hard muffs that would protect his fingers from bleeding. He was simply unstoppable.</p>
