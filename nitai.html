                <p>Locana dasa thakura said about Lord Nityananda;</p>
                <p><i>ābaddha karuṇā-sindhu niṭāi kāṭiyā mohān</i></p>

                <p><strong>"The ocean of mercy had formerly been sealed tight, but Nitai cut a channel in its boundary
                        to allow the great flooding waves of nectarean prema to splash from house to house."</strong>

            <p>Same way after disappearance of Glorious lion guru, Sri srimad Bhaktisiddhanta saraswati thakur prabhupād
                the flow of ocean of mercy was sealed. Everywhere was a drought. In the middle of this crisis the
                perfect representative and incarnation of Lord nityananda's shakti. His divine grace AC Bhaktivedanta
                Swami Srila Prabhupād with his Hare Krsna Explosion exploded the boundary line of that ocean of mercy
                and flooded the entire world with Krsna Prema. That's why Srila Prabhupād's God brothers offered their
                Salutations to him by saying;</p>
            <div class="shloka">
                <p><i>guruvajnam sirasi-dharyam saktyavesa svarupine</i></p>

                <p><strong>"Taking the order of his guru upon his head, he became empowered by Nityananda Prabhu to act
                        as a saktyavesa avatara. He distributed the Hare Krsna mantra all over the eastern and western
                        world, delivering and uplifting all fallen souls."</strong></p>
                <p><i>visvacarya pravaryaya divya karunya murtaye</i></p>

                <p><strong>"He is the best of millions of jagad-gurus, because he is the personification of divine
                        mercy. He has distributed the sweet nectar of Srimad Bhagavatam and the transcendental knowledge
                        of Bhagavad-gita all over the world.(¹)"</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p>This was the prophecy that Mahāprabhu gave five hundred years ago that has been fulfilled by our revered
                spiritual master, śri Śrimad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, guru, the previous ācāryas and
                Gaurānga Mahāprabhu Himself. Otherwise no one else could do such a wonderfully miraculous thing.
                Krşna-śakti vinā nahe tãra pravartana, without the assistance of krsna-śakti no one can do such a thing,
                through one's own effort. <strong>We should understand that Šrila Prabhupāda was completely empowered,
                    otherwise how could he fulfill the desires of Śriman Mahäprabhu?(²)</strong></p>
