                <p><i>prema namadbhutarthah sravana-patha-gatah kasya namnam mahimnah</i></p>
                <p><i>ko vetta kasya vrndavana-vipina-maha madhurisu pravesah</i></p>

                <p><i>ekas chaitanya-chandrah parama-karunaya sarvam avischakara</i></p>
                <p><strong>"Would anyone have heard that 'prema' divine love of God is the highest destination? Would
                        anyone have known the glory of the Holy Name? Would anyone have had access to the kadamba
                        forests of Vrndavan, filled with unfathomable sweetness? Would anyone have known Sri
                        Varsabhanavi devi Sri Radha, the highest worshippable Deity, who is the resplendent embodiment
                        of superb excellence of sweet ecstatic love? <i>(Ekas chaitanya chandra parama karunaya sarvam
                            avischakara) Only, Sri Chaitanya-chandra has revealed all this, by manifesting His supreme
                            magnanimous pastimes." {Sri chaitanya chandramrita, 10.130}</i></strong></p>
            </div>
            <p> This is well known fact that before advent of mahaprabhu the general populace was full of ignorance and
                under the doctrine of Illusion they all rejected the real dharma and only for their belly and genitals
                they worked like asses, the mis interpretations of four purusharthas were so prominent that the real
                religion was lost but Only Caitanya Mahaprabhu Single handedly pulled down the glorious fruit of love of
                godhead and distributed to all. Similarly, in this dark age of kaliyuga just 500 years later in the
                middle of this Animal conscious society, crushing their stupid independent sense gratification this
                commander in chief of Sachinandan Gaurhari single handedly <i>Ekas Prabhupada devah </i>Srila Prabhupad
                <i>parama karunayah </i> out of his great mercy and his own life he pulled down the eternal love of
                godhead from the spiritual world and distributed to all those who had no clue about it. Those who could
                have been engrossed in blind sense gratification only because of HDG A.C Bhaktivedanta swami srila
                prabhupad founder acarya of Iskcon are employed in transendental loving service of the lord of universe.
