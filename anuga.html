            <h1 class="heading">One who is a Prabhupada-anuga, is certainly a Raganuga-bhakta.</h1>
            <p class="image"><img src="images/anuga.jpg" /></p>
            <p>In Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura's Ragavarta-candrika (which contains a description of raganuga-sadhana), the essence of raganuga bhakti is explained thusly:</p>
            <p class="shloka">prathamatah krishnam smaran iti smaranasyatra </p>
            <p class="shloka">raganugayam mukhyetvam ragasya manodharmatvat</p>
            <p class="shloka"><i>"As raga (attachment to Krishna) is the occupation of the mind, so also simultaneously must be smarana (remembering Krishna); therefore smarana is the main limb of sadhana for the practioner of raganuga-bhakti." </i></p>
            <p>The idea here is that there can be no raganuga-bhakti without remembering Krishna. Therefore in essence raganuga-bhakti means the cultivation of remembrance of Krishna.</p>
            <p><strong>One who is a Prabhupada-anuga, is certainly a raganuga-bhakta. </strong>Is not Srila Prabhupada an eternal resident of Vrndavana? So if we aspire to follow Srila Prabhupada in his service to Krishna, there is no doubt that this is raganuga-bhakti. If we remember Srila Prabhupada's instructions and example in devotional service, that is smaranam, the essential limb of raganuga-bhakti. Srila Prabhupada's instruction to us is the same as Gauranga Mahaprabhu's to Lord Nityananda and Shrila Haridasa Thakura: </p>
            <p class="shloka">prati ghare ghere jai kara aei bhiksa bolo krishna bhaja krishna kara krishnasiksa</p>
            <p class="shloka"><i>"Go from door to door and beg everyone you see to chant Krishna's holy name, worship Krishna and hear the philosophy of Krishna consciousness."</i></p>
            <p>By executing this instruction, one is accepted into Lord Gauranga's lila in the mood of dasya-rasa. In this mood, one remembers one's own spiritual master as an eternal associate of Mahaprabhu who is handing His order to us: </p>
            <p class="shloka">pratah shriman-navadvipe dvi-netram dvi-bhujam gurum varabhaya-pradam santam smaret tan-nama-purvakam</p>
            <p class="shloka"><i>"In the morning (before engaging in Krishna's service) one should remember the spiritual master as being situated in Navadvipa-dhama, having two eyes and two arms, as being peaceful, and as bestowing all benediction and fearlessness upon chanting his name." </i></p>
            <p>And thus by the grace of Shri Shri Guru and Gauranga, the devotee who always remembers their order gets the adhikari (privilege) to enter in Radha-Krishna nitya-lila in Shri Vrndavana-dhama.</p>
