            <p><strong>Question: </strong><i> So what to do when one is destroying that faith by criticizing Srila
                    Prabhupada?</i></p>
            <p><strong>Anyone who criticizes Srila Prabhupada is a fool and a rascal. Don't have anything to do with
                    such people. If there is a syndrome of such faithlessness developing there, due to the blasphemous
                    utterances of useless people, then please request S Maharaj to hold isthagosthis and blast away this
                    bhakti-destroying nonsense. Anyone who carefully reads Srila Prabhupada's books can understand that
                    faith in him and in Krsna is not fanatical or dogmatic. Srila Prabhupada's books systematically and
                    reasonably present the science of Krsna-bhakti, and are internationally respected even by mundane
                    scholars.</strong></p>
