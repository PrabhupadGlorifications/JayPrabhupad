    <p><strong>Question: </strong><i> So what to do when one is destroying that faith by criticizing Srila Prabhupada?</i></p>
    <p><strong>Anyone who criticizes Srila Prabhupada is a fool and a rascal. Don't have anything to do with such people. If there is a syndrome of such faithlessness developing there, due to the blasphemous utterances of useless people, then please request S Maharaj to hold isthagosthis and blast away this bhakti-destroying nonsense. Anyone who carefully reads Srila Prabhupada's books can understand that faith in him and in Krsna is not fanatical or dogmatic. Srila Prabhupada's books systematically and reasonably present the science of Krsna-bhakti, and are internationally respected even by mundane scholars.</strong></p>
