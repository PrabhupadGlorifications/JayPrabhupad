            <p>Just in the ocean there are many big fishes. One fish is called timi, the whale fish. It is sometimes as
                big as one big house. And it is understood from the śāstras that there is another fish which is called
                timiṅgila. <strong>Timiṅgila means a big fish which can swallow up a whale as big as a house. So there
                    are so many big animals and big living entities all over the universe, but all of them are
                    production of a very little spiritual spark.</strong> <i> [Srila Prabhupada's Lecture on BG 7.4-5 --

                <p>The fish, sharks, tortoises and snakes were most agitated and perturbed. The entire ocean became
                    turbulent, and even the large aquatic animals like whales, water elephants, crocodiles and timiṅgila
                    fish [large whales that can swallow small whales] came to the surface. While the ocean was being
                    churned in this way, it first produced a fiercely dangerous poisoncalled hālahala.</p>

            <p>In Ramayana the Timingila is mentioned as inhabiting the waters between Lord Rama and Lanka, the capitol
                of the demon king, Ravana.</p>

                <p>“When the moon rose, the ocean surged and the image of the moon reflected unlimitedly in it. That
                    ocean abounded with huge crocodiles that were as swift as fierce winds, <strong>as well as whales

                <p><i>(Ramayana, Yuddha-kanda 4.114)</i></p>
            </div>
            <p>Similarly, Mahabharata mentions the Timingila as being deep within the ocean, along with other huge sea
                creatures.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Ayurvedic text of the 6th century BCE known as Susruta Samhita also lists the Timingila as being
                amongst the formidable species of marine life.

            <p>After all, has anyone actually seen any physical evidence of one of these monsters of the deep blue?
                Well, in fact they have – meet the Megalodon!</p>
            <p>Early accounts of large triangular teeth found imbedded in rock cliffs first appeared in Europe during
                the Renaissance period, but were believed to be the petrified tongues of dragons and snakes. In 1667 a
                Danish naturalist, Nicolaus Steno, recognized these findings as ancient shark teeth. In 1835 a Swiss
                naturalist, Louis Agassiz, gave this mysterious creature the name by which it is known today, Megalodon
                — which in Greek means ‘big tooth’.</p>
            <p>Thought to easily reach 82 plus feet in length, weighing in at 70 plus metric tons, with teeth measuring
                18 plus centimeters in length and capable of exerting a bite force of 40,131 pounds plus per square inch
                — the Megalodon is easily recognized as the greatest predator of all time.
            </p>
            <p>Fossil remains of the Megalodon, have been excavated from many parts of the world, including Europe,
                North America, South America, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Africa, Malta and India.
                Forensic studies of Megalodon fossils reveal that the predator was capable of eating anything in its
                path, but favored whale meat.</p>
            <p>According to scientific evidence it is estimated that the last of the Megalodons lived on this planet
                around 1.5 million years ago, give or take a few thousand. That is a long time ago, especially
                considering that the estimated age of the first human being was only 250,000 years ago. That would mean
                that the Megalodon became extinct 1,250,000 years before the first human being walked upright, spoke a
                coherent language, kept records or attempted to write anything.</p>
            <p>Carcharodon Megalodon
                By comparison of the size, haunt, predator behavior and dietary habits, the Megalodon and the Timingila
                appear to be the same creature. But what is so amazing or interesting about that and what is our point?
            </p>
            <p>Our point is that western scholars assert that the Bhagavatam was only written in the 9th century CE, the
                Ramayana in the 4th century BCE, and the Mahabharata between the 8th and 4th centuries BCE. But if this
                were a fact, then how did the writers of these books know about an ocean-dwelling creature, its size,
                its vicious aggression and its diet that had been extinct for 1.5 million years? Bhagavatam, Ramayana
                and Mahabharata all mention the existence of the Timingila/Megalodon. Where did they get this
                information?</p>
            <p>When (by scientific estimation) human beings have only been on this planet since 1,250,000 years after
                the Megalodon/Timingila became extinct — who told them about these creatures? If there were no humans
                present on this planet between the period when the Megalodon/Timingila became extinct and 250,000 years
                ago, how could the writers of the Vedic texts have known such things?
            </p>
            <p>The scientist and scholar will have to answer this question, but for us it is simple — there have always
                been human beings on this planet from its very creation and the knowledge of all such things has been
                passed down thru the ages via the disciplic succession of gurus and disciples.</p>
