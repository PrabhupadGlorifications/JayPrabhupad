             <p>A final point concerned the content of the journal and whether controversial subjects could be included and opposing responses printed along with our rebuttals. Prabhupada smiled, <i><strong>"Yes, that is nice. We invite, 'All right, come on.'" "Criticize, and we will defeat you," </strong>a devotee rejoined. "Yes, it is fighting."</i></p>
             <p>Prabhupada said, with a gleam in his eye. He encouraged them to recruit as many scholars as possible, especially in India where there are many Ph.D.s who are also Vaishnavas. He wants them to use the magazine to challenge and defeat materialists and atheists. Prabhupada told them to try their best, and Krishna will give them intelligence. He said he started the fight alone, but now Krishna has sent them to help.</p>
