            <p>In 1969, when Prabhupāda stayed at John Lennon's estate, he liked to walk in the misty morning through the gardens and groves.</p>
            <p>It was there that Prabhupāda met the head gardener, an old English gentleman who used to wear a tweed suit jacket even when digging in the earth. The gardener had shown no interest in the philosophy or the devotees, but when Prabhupāda came he was interested to meet him. On Prabhupāda's first morning walk the head gardener presented himself. Prabhupāda was also dressed in a gentlemanly way, wearing a long black coat, black hat, and Wellington boots.</p>
            <p>"I am the head gardener here," said the man. Prabhupāda said he was glad to meet him and asked him, <i><strong> "What are you growing?" </strong></i>The gardener cagerly showed Prabhupāda some of the plants and fruits he was raising in the greenhouse, including watermelons and varieties of flowers. He also pulled out trays from underneath a greenhouse table and showed Prabhupāda his mushrooms. <i><strong>"Oh, we do not eat this," </strong></i>said Prabhupāda. <i><strong>"This is fungus."</strong></i> The man admitted that it was a fungus. Prabhupāda explained that mushrooms do not have a good taste, and because they grow in a dark, damp place, they are considered food in the mode of Ignorance. Srila Prabhupāda then suggested that the gardener should try to grow ladyfingers, but the man didn't know what Prabhupāda meant. Prabhupāda pointed to his own fingers. <i><strong>You should grow these ladyfingers."</strong></i> He gave the Hindi word, bhindī, which the man also couldn't understand. Finally the gardener understood that Prabhupāda was talking about <i>okra.</i> Prabhupāda asked if the man could grow mangos, but he said he couldn't, not even in the greenhouse.</p>
            <p><i><strong>What is your age?" </strong></i>asked Prabhupāda.The gardener replied that he was sixty-six. Prabhupāda said,<i><strong> "Do you still have all your teeth?" </strong></i>The gardener seemed to be a little embarrassed, but replied, "No, I don't. I have all false teeth."<i><strong> "My age is seventy-two," </strong></i>said Prabhupāda, <i><strong>"but I have all my teeth."</strong></i> Prabhupāda opened his mouth and showed. The gardener replied, "I've lost all my teeth be cause I like sweet things too much." <i><strong>"I also like sweets,"</strong></i> said Prabhupāda. <i><strong>"I eat many sweets myself-rasagullā, gulãbjamüns. But I am eating the right kind of sweets. You should also eat these sweets."</strong></i></p>
            <p>After that, when taking his morning walk, Prabhupāda regularly greeted the gardener with a few words, or at least, whenever the gardener was working at a distance, they exchanged a wave of hands.</p>
