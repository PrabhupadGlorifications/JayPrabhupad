    <p><strong>Lord Narasimha roars loudly and causes others to roar. With His multitudes of arms He tears the demons asunder and kills them in this way. He is always seeking out and tormenting the demoniac descendants of Diti, both on this earth planet and in the higher planets, and He throws them down and scatters them. He cries with great anger as He destroys the demons in all directions, yet with His unlimited hands He sustains, protects, and nourishes the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances to the Lord, who has assumed the form of a transcendental lion.</strong></p>

        Similarly, Śrīla Prabhupāda just like Sri Narasimha and his own Guru Mahārāja Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Saraswati Thakur roars loudly the crystal clear and bold message of unalloyed devotional service of Sri Sri Rādhā Rās Bihāri, and also causes his real followers to roar in a similar manner against all atheistic and pseudo-devotional stool worms. With multiple techniques, logic and his divine purports he kills the demons in our heart. He is always seeking out and tormenting the demoniac elements and kali-chelas within ISKCON and in the entire world, and he throws them down and scatters them. His ecstasy and ecstatic anger destroys the annarthas of his followers and fills their heart with love of godhead. And with his unlimited hands In the form of his true disciples, followers, instructions and without a doubt, the multitude of his Divine Books he sustains, protects and nourishes the whole Vaishnava world. I offer my respectful obeisances to <strong>His Divine Grace A.C Bhaktivedānta Swāmi Śrīla Prabhupāda</strong> who has assumed the form of a ferocious lion and also like a gentle cow, to nourish and protect our devotion and take us back to the Lord of lords Sri Krsna. </p>
    <p><strong>Śrīla Prabhupād ki! Jay!!</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Sri Narsimha dev Bhagvān ki Jay!!</strong></p>
