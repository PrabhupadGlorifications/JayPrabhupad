             <p>Another time I gave Prabhupada a twenty-four carat gold ring that said, “Jai ISKCON” on it. Then one other ring I gave to Prabhupada just had a “P” on it. Years later I saw Prabhupada still had that ring. I said, “Prabhupada, you still have that ring?” He said, <i><strong>“Yes, it is a good ring.”</strong></i> Later on he ended up giving it to someone, and he said, <i><strong>“I am not attached.” </strong></i>Prior to him giving it away, however, Sudama noticed the ring while he was massaging Prabhupada. He asked him, “Oh, Prabhupada! I see you have a new ring.” “Yes.” “Who gave it to you?” Prabhupada just looked at me, turned back and said, <i><strong>“Oh, someone.”</strong></i>  It was so subtle and intimate at the same time. He could have said, “Oh, Bhurijana gave that to me.” But he just made it so personal and in that way it was like a secret that only he and I shared.</p>
