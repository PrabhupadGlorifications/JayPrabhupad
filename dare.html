             <p>On another occasion in Māyāpur, Prabhupāda alerted the artist that his spontaneous expression was unauthorized. While painting large portraits from the Caitanya caritāmrta on the boundary wall to ISKCON Māyāpur, the artist had created his own original Bengali verse and painted it in large script. When Śrīla Prabhupāda first noticed it, while on a morning walk, he became disturbed. </p>
             <p><i><strong>“You should not have dared!,”  </strong></i>he said. The verse employed a metaphor praising Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda . Prabhupāda said the sentiment wasn't bad, although the Bengali wasn't perfect— but the main objection was that his disciple had dared to put his own verse on the wall rather than one provided by the previous ācāryās, such as Narottama Dāsa Thākura. Śrīla Prabhupāda even mentioned the incident in that morning's Bhāgvatam class. <i><strong>“Don't concoct,”</strong></i> he said. <i><strong>“The sahajiyā tendency is to take everything cheaply. Don't do this”</strong></i> said Prabhupāda, <i><strong>“or you will become a sahajiyā and everything will be ruined.”</strong></i></p>
