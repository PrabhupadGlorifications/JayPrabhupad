                        opulence you can give Him.”</strong></p>

                Krsna said to arjuna in battlefield of kurukshetra <i>pradhanyatah kuru-srestha nasty anto vistarasya me
                </i><strong> O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.</strong>(10.19) this is declared universally by
                lord and he has showed this fact at every step by displaying his opulence in his bhauma-lila. but
                something which does not fits in the tiny minds of the population is that by service of krsna, krsna
                takes care of all needs of his devotee as said by prabhupad:</p>
            <p><strong><i>Therefore, by serving Krishna directly the result of the service indirectly comes to
                        us</i></strong> (Letter to yamuna) </p>
            <p>By his immense and extraordinary service to the opulent lord <i>Sri Jagannath</i> Srila Prabhupad was
                also an opulent sannyasi. The world never saw a sannyasi who is so opulent and opulent to this extent.
                Anyone who saw him got captivated by his presence. No one can Forget Srila Prabhupad.</p>
