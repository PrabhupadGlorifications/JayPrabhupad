                <p><strong>Simply by decorating ourselves with the garlands, fragrant oils, clothes and ornaments that
                        You have already enjoyed, and by eating the remnants of Your meals, we, Your servants, will
                        indeed conquer Your illusory energy.</strong> (SB 11.6.46)</p>
            </div>
            <p>As Uddhava says that by getting krsna's remnants and other enjoyed transendental items, we his servants
                will indeed conquer his material illusory energy which is very strong. Same way Srila prabhupad's
                remnants, instructions, glance, even wind coming from the direction where he and his devotees are
                standing, purifies his devoted servants. </p>

                <p><i>tāṅra upadeśa-mantre piśācī palāya</i></p>

            <p><strong>By Srila Prabhupad's instructions the witch of maya flies away.</strong> One can conquer Maya by
                constantly remembering Krsna's and Srila Prabhupad's lotus feets, Prabhupad writes in purport; <i>"Even
                    if Your illusory energy tries to attack us, my Lord, we will very easily conquer her by <strong>our
                        powerful weapons, which are the remnants of Your foodstuffs, clothes, ornaments, and so on. In
                        other words, we will easily conquer over māyā by kṛṣṇa-prasādam, and not by useless speculation
                        and mental concoction.” </strong></i>Yes among all the weapons this is most powerful
                _caranopasnastra_ the weapon of loving service to Lotus feets of sri guru and gauranga!. One should not
                waste time in concoctions and mental speculations but keep on rendering service.</p>
            <div class="shloka">
                <p><i>guror hareś caraṇopāsanāstro jahi vyalīkaṁ svayam ātma-moṣam</i></p>

            </div>
            <p><strong><i> Please try to conquer this mind by the weapon of service to the lotus feet of the spiritual
                        master and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. </i></strong>So that by this service we will
                get kripa as Krsna Prasad and Krsna kripa murti prasad means Prabhupad's Prasad, by the strength of
                these great weapons we the eternal servants of Srila Prabhupad will Conquer Maya. </p>
