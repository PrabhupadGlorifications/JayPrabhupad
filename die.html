    <p>So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura became very much... <strong>Because a devotee cannot tolerate blaspheming another devotee or God. </strong>So as soon as he said that <i> "Why shall I go to Jagannātha Purī to see the wooden Jagannātha? I am personally Viṣṇu,"</i> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura immediately ordered his constables, <i><strong>"Arrest him. Arrest this rascal." </strong></i>So he was arrested.</p>
    <p>And when he was arrested—he had some yogic mystic power—all the constables, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and his family member became affected with high fever, 105 degrees fever. So when he came back, his wife became very much disturbed that <i>"You arrested Viṣṇu, and we are all going to die. We have got now high fever." </i>Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura replied, <i><strong>"Yes, let us all die, but this rascal must be punished." This is the view of pure devotee.</strong></i></p>
