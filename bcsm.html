                One day an unusual, young Bengali man came to Mayapur. Named Kisore, he was a Vaisnava from birth and
                obviously intelligent. He spoke impeccable English and was also fluent in German because he was a
                student in a German university. With simply a little coaxing, he surrendered to Srila Prabhupada and
                quickly got initiated, receiving the name <i>Ksira-cora-gopinatha dasa.</i> On several occasions he kindly translated conversations between Pisima and me. Several months later, Srila Prabhupada awarded this cultured young man sannyasa, changing his name to <strong>Bhakti Caru Swami.</strong>

            <p>Who can ever understand the potency of Mercy, of such Great Vaishnavas? Who are by nature merciful
                towards the fallen conditioned souls. <i>mahānta-svabhāva ei tārite pāmara</i> (Cc M 8.39) By nature it's a
                general practice of these saintly devotees of the Lord to <i>tārite pāmara</i> to deliver the fallen soul.
                We can only gather Information, for realizing we must depend on the mercy of the Merciful Lord and his devotees. What else is in our hand?
