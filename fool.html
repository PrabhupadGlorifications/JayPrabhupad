            <p class="image"><img src="images/fool.jpg" /></p>
            <p> A very famous and old Marathi music play <i>"Sangeet Manapmaan"</i> has a song in the glorification of
                battle soldiers which says "Let your body become fragrant like sandalwood in the battlefield". Now if we
                see this highly poetic and decorated style of writing which actually makes the soldier to die for his
                country, even if his country is rascal number one still after getting so much poetically dignified the
                innocent jiva gives upon his life on the battlefield which is rarely acheived only for God Realisation.
                If practically we analyse these lines, then it makes no sense as everyone knows the dead body of any
                materially dignified person, freedom fighter, pious leader or a thief, criminal, etc will only stink
                once the living force is gone. But still getting cheated by these sugarcoated and decorated words of
                others and for snatching away someone's temporary enjoyment to satisfy one's own senses which are not
                permanent either such a society which is based on sense gratification with limited sources but unlimited
                greed, dishonesty, envy, jealousy and selfishness. This material world is full of fools and fooled as
                Srila Prabhupada said <strong>"Cheaters & Cheated."</strong> </p>
