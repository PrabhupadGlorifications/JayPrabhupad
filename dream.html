             <p>Sometime just before morning, I Dream.</p>
             <p>I Dream of devotees clustered about an effulgent, golden personality. His transcendental body, radiating a beauty strange to the world, captivates everyone. Stunned me, I enquire, "Who is he?"</p>
             <p>"Don't you know?" someone says. "That's Swamiji!"</p>
             <p>I look again, but see no resemblance. The golden person, seeming no older than twenty, appears to have descended straight from the Vaikuntha planets. "If that's Swamiji, "I wonder to myself, "why doesn't he come to earth like that?" A voice somewhere within answers : <i><strong>"People would follow me for my beauty, not my teachings."</strong></i></p>
             <p>Then, astonishingly enough, I see the radiant personality turn into Swamiji and then quickly back into the beautiful demigod. He does this several times, and I watch awestruck. </p>
             <p>And I awake with the dream clear in my mind, more like a vision than a dream. I feel strangely refreshed, as though bathed in some unknown balm. Again, I see that the constellations have shifted and that the dinner stars have faded into the encroaching dawn. </p>
             <p>Pondering what I had seen, I recall Swamiji's saying that although most dreams are simply functions of the mind, dreams of the spiritual master are of spiritual significance. <i><strong> "If the guru gives instructions in a dream," </strong></i>he told me, <i><strong>"the disciple is supposed to follow them."</strong></i></p>
             <p>Then : "I came to the West after my spiritual master repeatedly advised me in a number of dreams." </p>
             <p>I lie still, watching the now waning stars in the clear air and thinking about the golden demigod. </p>
             <p>Then dawn begins to break.</p>
