             <p><strong>Nanda Kishor Dasa :</strong> Janos Damburgs was an intellectual studying for his Ph.D. at McGill University, but from the time that he was thirteen he was looking for someone who could tell him about God. Once, at Dr. Mishra's ashram in upstate New York, Damburgs asked Dr. Mishra about God. Dr. Mishra said, <i>"Don't worry, just meditate." </i>Prabhupada was at the asrama then, and the next day at breakfast in the big breakfast hall when all the uptown yoga ashram visitors were sitting eating, Prabhupada went to Damburgs and said, <i><strong>"Would you like to go for a walk?" </strong></i>Damburgs was taken aback but said, <i>"Yes." </i>As they walked on the big campus, Prabhupada said, <i><strong>"This grass is so nice. Only Krishna could make a carpet like this." </strong></i>As they walked further, Prabhupada said, <i><strong>"You see that pond over there?"</strong></i> Damburgs said, <i>"Yes."</i> Prabhupada said, <i><strong>"There are millions and millions of living entities in that pond that we cannot perceive, but Krishna knows every one of them." </strong></i> A little later, Damburg looked at the tilak on Prabhupada's forehead and said, <i>"What does that mark on your forehead stand for?"</i></p>
             <p>Prabhupada said, <i><strong>"It stands for victory." </strong></i>That was the beginning of Damburg's relationship with Prabhupada. Later he became initiated as <strong>Janardana.</strong></p>
