            <p><strong>Guest: </strong>Why You Glorify Srila Prabhupāda, so much as no one else exists for you isn't
                this sectarianism? </p>
            <p><strong>Admin: </strong>Else? Who else?</p>
            <p><strong>Guest: </strong>Krishna, Rama, other Vaishnava Gurus, current day ISKCON gurus... </p>
            <p><strong>Admin: </strong>I am not a born pure devotee and I am still not even a devotee, I don't know
                about you but I am not. For me and many of us present in this age of kali yuga specially in this time
                who is Bramha? Siva? Indra? Madhvacarya? Ramanujacarya? Nimbaditya? Visnuswami? Chaitanya mahaprabhu?
                The Goswamis? Bhakti vinode? Bhaktisiddhanta? Who is Jayapataka swami? Bhakticaru swami, Bhaktivikas
                swami, Tamal krsna swami, Gopal krsna swami? Lokanath swami? What is Vrindavan, Navadweep? What to speak
                of their lord.. <strong>For us Prabhupāds books! Lectures! They gave us everything.</strong></p>
            <p> Now that I can know that there is an incarnation of Lord named Chaitanya is because of Srila Prabhupāda.
                I could not even pronounce the names of Great acaryas, now I know their life and teachings because of
                whom? The current gurus of ISKCON are gurus because of whom? Without Srila Prabhupada who are they? Now
                I know them, respect them, I have accepted one of them as my Guru maharaj all this because of whom? I
                was not born in any Dhama, I was just a Bombay boy, now I am hankering for Sri Vrindāvan that's because
                of <strong>HDG A.C Bhaktivedānta Swami Srila Prabhupada... </strong> </p>
            <p><strong>Guest: </strong>But now Srila Prabhupada is not physically present now those are present they
                should be put forward. </p>
            <p><strong>Admin: </strong>Aree, when Lord Chaitanya, scriptures, great Acaryas Glorified Srila Prabhupada
                even before his advent, Lord Sri Krsna Glorified him by making him appear on the second day of his
                Janmāstami, great spiritual as well as material personalities glorified him when he was exhibiting his
                bhauma lila. <strong> Why!? Why!? Should I stop glorifying him when he has left only for a mortal
                    vision, don't you read his books!? If not then start reading, SRILA PRABHUPADA IS THERE FOR 10,000
                    YEARS? NO! FOR-EVER HE IS ETERNAL.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Guest: </strong>But Institution.. </p>
            <p><strong>Admin: </strong>Oh, you don't worry about it, this is not Gaudia Math. There will be absolutely
                no problem not in present never in future. Everyone will keep Srila Prabhupada in front always. You, me,
                gurus, GBC, other followers even a hired sweeper in the temple will Keep only Srila Prabhupada in front.
                And if we keep him in front we will run smooth, otherwise we will be divided and our spiritual potency
                will be lost. Thankyou very much.</p>
