            <p><strong>Lokanath Swami: </strong>One time, while we were on the way to Mayapur with his bullock cart sankirtan, I wrote to Prabhupada hinting that we needed financial help to maintain the program.</p>
            <p>Prabhupada responded by sending me a letter with big sankirtan scores showing how many books were being distributed. He said that this is how we maintain our institution, by book distribution, and that I also had to do this. He said that outside help was not healthy. If my program was to be appreciated by the public, their appreciation should be practical. They should help by assisting me. Otherwise it was just lip service. In this way he encouraged us to increase book distribution in our bullock cart sankirtan program.</p>
