             <p>We arranged a press conference for Prabhupād, and quite a few reporters came. </p>
             <p><i>“Swamiji, you are an ascetic and you are preaching about renunciation of the material world. Yet you are sitting in luxury in the Hong Kong Hilton. Isn't that hypocritical?”</i></p>
             <p>Prabhupād started philosophically. <strong>“First you must understand what is renunciation. Nothing is ours. Everything belongs to Krsna. What is harm if Krsna's servant uses Krsna's opulence to glorify Krsna?”</strong></p>
             <p>Prabhupād noted that the reporter wasn't satisfied and took another tact. <strong>“Personally, I am not attached. I could live under a tree and be satisfied.”</strong></p>
             <p>The reporters interest increased with the mention of living under a tree. Perhaps he had a human interest story. </p>
             <p><i><strong>“But”</strong></i> Prabhupād added, <i><strong>“If I was living under a tree and called a press conference...” </strong></i>Prabhupād paused for a moment to allow the situation he was describing to capture the reporter's imaginations, <i><strong>“and if I invited all the reporters, would you have attended?”</strong></i></p>
             <p>Everyone laughed, Prabhupād's example made Yukta-vairagya clear: using Krsna's opulences in Krsna's service was practical renunciation. </p>
