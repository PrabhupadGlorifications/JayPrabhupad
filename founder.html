             <p>When I was Srila Prabhupāda's personal servant, I noted many times that he would insist that on any printed material the title <strong>Founder-Ācārya</strong> and his full name be printed under the society's name of ISKCON. I was very immature and inexperienced at that time and often wondered, <i>"śrila Prabhupāda is such a humble and exalted Vaisnava, why is he so persistently insisting on this?" </i>I did not ever openly express this to Srila Prabhupāda, but it continued to perplex me. But slowly, by his divine grace, in due course of time, I began to understand his intent. The phrase <strong> "Founder-Acārya"</strong> is not just a title but a transcendental system intended to protect, preserve and give longevity to an institution dedicated to the mass liberation of conditioned Souls all over this world in this dark abysmal age of Kali. Great Vaisnava stalwarts like Sri Madhvācârya and Rāmānujācărya successfully implemented this system.</p>
