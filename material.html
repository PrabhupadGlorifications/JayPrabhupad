    <p> A very famous and old Marathi music play <i>"Sangeet Manapmaan"</i> has a song in the glorification of battle soldiers which says "Let your body become fragrant like sandalwood in the battlefield". Now if we see this highly poetic and decorated style of writing which actually makes the soldier to die for his country, even if his country is rascal number one still after getting so much poetically dignified the innocent jiva gives upon his life on the battlefield which is rarely acheived only for God Realisation. If practically we analyse these lines, then it makes no sense as everyone knows the dead body of any materially dignified person, freedom fighter, pious leader or a thief, criminal, etc will only stink once the living force is gone. But still getting cheated by these sugarcoated and decorated words of others and for snatching away someone's temporary enjoyment to satisfy one's own senses which are not permanent either such a society which is based on sense gratification with limited sources but unlimited greed, dishonesty, envy, jealousy and selfishness. This material world is full of fools and fooled as Srila Prabhupada said <strong>"Cheaters & Cheated."</strong> </p>
