            <p><strong>Dinatarini devi :</strong> <i>Yamuna was always alert to try to get any morsel of mercy from
                    Srila Prabhupada. Dhananjaya remembered their waiting in the airport for their KLM flight, and a
                    piece of Srila Prabhupada’s cane came loose. Srila Prabhupada broke it off and had his servant put
                    it in the dustbin. Yamuna, watching this, immediately went over to the dustbin, removed the piece of
                    Prabhupada’s walking stick, and stuck it in her diary. This was a beautiful remembrance which was so
                    indicative of Yamuna’s nature. Anything that came from Srila Prabhupada—his words, instructions,
                    chastisements, remnants of his clothing, his writing, even his tooth—she kept and cherished as
                    living reminders of him to be worshipped always. Fortunately, the wonderful photos of this episode
                    capture Yamuna’s one-pointed attention to what Srila Prabhupada was doing with the cane—just waiting
                    for the opportunity to get this little piece of <strong>‘Prabhupada mercy.’</strong></i></p>
