            <p>Due to immature or zero understanding of Krsna consciousness, here some kids, who are claiming to be
                devotees are seen, reacting on <i>Funny videos</i> and speaking all kinds of trash, under the name of
                Bridge Preaching or some Neo Krsna Conscious tactic to attract people of particular age-group.</p>
            <p>Personally, I feel reacting on social issues from an uncompromising philosophical point of view, is a
                brilliant way of preaching as done by our predecessor Ācaryas. But here unfortunately nothing devotional
                is Visible but Mundane talks in and of course in mundane way is clearly Visible to any staunch follower
                of Krsna Consciousness under the ultimate guidance of Srila Prabhupada. </p>
            <p>As Listed by Srila Rupa Goswāmi Prabhupada in his Book <i>Sri Upadesāmrta</i> which is presented as
                <i>Nectar of Instructions</i> by ISKCON founder-Acarya. Rupa goswamipad writes on how ones bhakti is
                destroyed. He says, </p>
            <div class="shloka">
                <p> atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca</p>
                <p><strong> prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ</strong></p>
                <p> jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca</p>
                <p> ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati</p>
                <p> (Nectar of instructions verse 2)</p>
            </div>

            <p>According to Sri Rupa, out of 6 activities which spoil bhakti 2 are <strong><i>Prajalpa</i></strong> and
                <strong><i>niyamagraha</i></strong> Prajalpa means, <strong>talking unnecessarily about mundane subject
                    matters</strong> or talks devoid of Krsna. "When we mix with a few friends, we immediately begin
                unnecessary talking, sounding just like croaking toads. If we must talk, we should talk about the Kṛṣṇa
                consciousness movement. Those outside of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are interested in reading
                heaps of newspapers, magazines and novels, solving crossword puzzles and doing many other nonsensical
                things. In this fashion people simply waste their valuable time and energy.[1]" The first principle of
                Bhakti is to not desire anything except krsna, if we indulge ourselves in any activity devoid of Krsna
                Consciousness, we are breaking the basic pillars of bhakti. it's just like bathing of elephant; his
                cleaning has no value because he again loiters in mud, same way if this subtle and minute alertness is
                missing then there is no value of our Sadhna. Secondly, niyamāgrahaḥ; generally, the common symptom in
                all such neophyte devotees is to either taking the rules and regulations as cheap or very restrictive
                killer of Independence types. Or to completely ignore them because of some hidden agendas like gaining
                followers and mundane benefits etc. which is the third impediment laulyaṁ in the path of bhakti. Under
                niyamagraha, failing to follow these strict regulations will ultimately degrade oneself to become a
                Sahajiya deviant and that will obstruct one's own progress and others as well. </p>

            <p><strong>Personal & humble Advice to such Content creators.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><i> Stop it! </i></strong><i>and take this movement in a grave and serious manner. under the name
                    of bridge preaching {if that is your intention} don't mispresent the movement standards. By looking
                    at you young devotees many newcomers will think that watching reels, useless videos, following
                    trends is all okay in devotional life. And if you all don't know about the rules and regulations,
                    please read Srila Prabhupad Books very seriously especially this nectar of instructions. Please
                    contact me at <a href="mailto:bhagavadgyaan06@gmail.com" target="_blank">
                        bhagavadgyaan06@gmail.com</a> for any further clarification. Don't take it as humiliating, I am
                    your well-wisher, remember by bringing people in bhakti with such tactics we are not doing any good
                    to them, someday they have to change, and you have to answer them but how? when you are only busy in
                    doing these stupid things. Grow up! Be responsible! This movement is for Serious students not for
                    funky entertainers.</i></p>
