             <p><strong>Brajendra-nandana Dasa : </strong>Srila Prabhupād went to Boston College in 1968. As I said, I wasn’t there, but I was told this by Hamsaduta Prabhu. At the end of his talk, a very disheveled hippy boy, looking unkempt and not dressed well, got up and challenged and he said to Prabhupada that he was God and that we are all God and that it’s all one. He went on and on. Prabhupada didn’t say a word. Normally while dealing with impersonalists, he would be like fire. But Prabhupada just sat there. The boy found that he ran out of steam. Prabhupada looked up and said, <i><strong> “So you are God?” </strong></i>Everybody just laughed – the entire audience. The boy was defeated without even a philosophical argument, just to see this person standing there, so disheveled and then Prabhupada saying to him, <i><strong> “So you are God?” </strong></i>He was so expert in any situation that he came in touch with. <strong>Like I said, he was our hero.</strong></p>
